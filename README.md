## Introduction

Amazon reviews provide valuable insights into customer opinions about products, and sentiment analysis helps automate the process of understanding these opinions at scale. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a sentiment analysis model that can classify Amazon reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess raw text data from Amazon reviews.
- **Model Training:** Train a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using various metrics.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model for real-time sentiment analysis on new reviews.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the results and insights derived from the sentiment analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle Notebook (optional)
- Required libraries (specified in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews.git
    cd sentiment-analysis-amazon-reviews
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

    ```python
    # Run the data preprocessing script
    python preprocess_data.py
    ```

2. **Model Training:**

    ```python
    # Train the sentiment analysis model
    python train_model.py
    ```

3. **Evaluation:**

    ```python

    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

4. **Deployment:**

    ```python
    # Deploy the model for real-time sentiment analysis
    python deploy_model.py
    ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of Amazon reviews across various product categories. The raw data is preprocessed to extract relevant features for model training.

## Model

The sentiment analysis model is built using [insert ML library or framework here], leveraging [insert algorithm here]. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of Amazon reviews.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. The evaluation results are presented in the `evaluation_results.md` file.

## Results
